<span style="font-size:0.9em;">
I am a PostDoc at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in [Stochastic Processes and Applied Statistics Research Group](https://stochproc.kaust.edu.sa/). </span> 

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">I work at the intersection of probability, analysis, and computational statistics, with a focus on stochastic modeling and simulation. My research revolves around stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), where I investigate both foundational theoretical questions—such as well-posedness, path regularity, and ergodicity—and applied challenges in statistical inference, uncertainty quantification, and computation methods. A central aim is to develop methods that are rigorously justified and validated through robust numerical implementations. To this end, I leverage tools from Monte Carlo simulation, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), stochastic and functional analysis. Ultimately, I seek to strengthen the bridge between deep probabilistic insight and real-world modeling, especially in systems where randomness, geometry, and nonlinearity combine to produce rich and complex behaviour.
